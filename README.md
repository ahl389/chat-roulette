# Chatroom Roulette

This is an anonymous chatroom application that let's you join a random existing chatroom or create your own. When users create a chatroom they set the topic. Chatrooms disappear when their creator signs offline.

This app was built with Twilio's Programmable Chat product, and with the help of the Twilio SDK Starter Application for Python.

### Upcoming Features to be Added
- mobile version
- random, automatic assignment of new room when current room closes (no button click)
- logins/usernames that aren't randomly assigned
- typing indicator
- better handling of closed chatrooms
